- python3 and python3-pip **OR** Docker
- git **OR** curl

## Manual installation

### Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/sundowndev/PhoneInfoga
cd PhoneInfoga/
```

You can also download the source code archive :

To ensure everything works, use the `-v` option to show the version : 

```shell
python3 phoneinfoga.py -v
```

### Install the Geckodriver

The Geckodriver is the Firefox webdriver for Selenium, which is used by PhoneInfoga to perform queries to Google search and handle captcha. Firefox is actually the only webdriver supported by PhoneInfoga.

!!! tip "Want to hack it to use chrome or another driver instead ? See [this file](https://github.com/sundowndev/PhoneInfoga/blob/8179fe4857ca7df2d843119e2123c260e8401818/lib/googlesearch.py#L35)."

#### Linux

##### Download

Go to the [geckodriver releases page](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). Find the latest version of the driver for your platform and download it. For example: 

```shell
curl -L https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.24.0/geckodriver-v0.24.0-linux64.tar.gz -o geckodriver-v0.24.0-linux64.tar.gz
```

##### Extract the file

```shell
tar -xzf geckodriver-*.tar.gz -O > /usr/bin/geckodriver
```

##### Make it executable

```shell
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/geckodriver
```

##### Remove the archive

```shell
rm geckodriver-*.tar.gz
```

!!! note
    You also have to install Firefox browser v65+. To verify everything is working fine, use the following commands:

    - `which firefox` should return something like `/usr/bin/firefox`
    - `which geckodriver` should return something like `/usr/bin/geckodriver`

#### MacOS

You can use brew to install the geckodriver

```
brew install geckodriver
```

It should then be installed at `/usr/local/bin/geckodriver`.

#### Windows

```
version: "3"

services:
  phoneinfoga:
    image: sundowndev/phoneinfoga
    container_name: phoneinfoga
    restart: on-failure
    environment:
      webdriverRemote: 'http://selenium-hub:4444/wd/hub'

  selenium-hub:
    image: selenium/hub:3.141.59-palladium
    container_name: selenium-hub
    ports:
      - "4444:4444"

  firefox:
    image: selenium/node-firefox:3.141.59-palladium
    volumes:
      - /dev/shm:/dev/shm
    depends_on:
      - selenium-hub
    environment:
      - HUB_HOST=selenium-hub
      - HUB_PORT=4444
```

### From the source code

You can download the source code, then build the docker images
